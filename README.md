# Motivation

I used the [Files](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Files) in [the first Rugby version](https://github.com/swiftyfinch/Rugby/blob/1.23.0/Package.swift#L15).
But this library has some drawbacks:\
`-` There are some issues with files enumeration;\
`-` It has limited testability;\
`-` Now it looks like a public archive. The last request was merged in 2022.

## Description

`Fish` is a small library that was developed to solve the above problems.\
It providing convenient wrappers for interacting with the file system.\
Under the hood it uses [`FileManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager) and other parts of [`Foundation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation).

This library was a part of üèà [Rugby 2.x](https://github.com/swiftyfinch/Rugby).
